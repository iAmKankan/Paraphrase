## DESCRIPTION OVERVIEW

Paraphrase generation is the task of generating an output sentence that preserves the meaning of the input sentence with variations in word choice and grammar.

> Two sentences are paraphrases if their meanings are equivalent but their words and syntax are different.

The Problematic Paper Screener project searches through published science and seeks out “tortured phrases” in order to find suspect work. A tortured phrase is an established scientific concept paraphrased into a nonsensical sequence of words. Academic fraudsters and modern plagiarists are turning words like **“Artificial Intelligence”** into **“counterfeit consciousness”**, and **“Mean square error”** into **“mean square blunder”**.

Learning about Paraphrase Generation methods helps us not only to spot these kinds of threats, but also to exploit the bright side of paraphrasing: expand our understanding.

Paraphrasing can be used to aid comprehension, stimulate prior knowledge, and assist in writing-skills development.

Paraphrasing text can facilitate reading comprehension by transforming the text into a more familiar, and in the field of composition, allow writers to restate ideas from other works or their own drafts so that the reformatted language may better suit a voice, flow, or line of argument.
